# gulp-react-css-usage
`// remove this`<br>
This project is in it's very initial steps,
I hope to finish it in the next few days and update a working version.<br>
`// end of remove`

A Gulp task which scans your react classes ( `.js` / `.jsx` ), your CSS files, and gives you a report of CSS coverage.<br>
.i.e how many class names are needless and which are those class names.

In this way, you can tremendously accelerate the rendering time of your app by reducing latency, loading and parsing time,
as the CSS file is smaller with less properties to process and etc.
